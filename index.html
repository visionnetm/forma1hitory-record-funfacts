<h2>The Birth of Formula 1 (1950–1960)</h2>

The Formula 1 World Championship was officially founded in 1950, with the first race
held at Silverstone, United Kingdom. Early F1 cars were dangerous, raw and mechanical,
offering little protection to drivers.

Legends like Juan Manuel Fangio dominated the early years, winning five world championships
with teams such as Alfa Romeo, Mercedes-Benz, Ferrari and Maserati.
